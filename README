This is my first attempt at a HTML5 canvas game. I think it worked out pretty well. There are some bugs at the moment
that i will try fix soon, one being that you can flag a square, and click it to reveal it so that both the number of 
adjacent mines and the flag image appears.

Hope you enjoy the game!
